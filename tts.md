Hey, I have this TTS model, Kokoro, with running using MLX. So what I want is like, I want to, like, select some text and let's say I run a command, terminal command maybe, and it's going to do TTS on the text. And I want it to streaming form. So it shouldn't like convert the whole thing and then play. Instead of it, it should like stream as it goes through it. And it should have option to like stop the streaming playback in a higher rate or some other control. So basically like, when I select the text and press a keyboard button, maybe it should have something on the Mac menu item for those control like the pause or speed up or stop the speaking. But the thing is like I want it to streaming immediately without having translating the whole thing.
